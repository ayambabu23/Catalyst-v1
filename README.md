# Catalyst-v1
Used pylessons/TensorFlow-2.x-YOLOv3 as baseline YOLO model. This project seeked to take machine learning and cricket and combine both of them.
It isn't perfect at the moment, as it trained on a general ball dataset, rather than a specific cricket ball dataset. Because of this reason, any spheres on the screen are detected as a ball, even though oftentimes they wouldn't be.
My next step is definitely going to be using specific cricket ball datasets, but since there aren't any available online, I would have to look for solutions and find ways to outsource some of the manual labelling.
